=== HIVEMIND DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS ===
Project: Hivemind - Multi-AI Collaboration Platform
Repository: https://github.com/LeoLin990405/Hivemind.git
Started: 2026-02-15
Last Updated: 2026-02-15

=== BASELINE STATE ===
Commit: 1fc570a - refactor: Update utility scripts and nexus integration
Branch: main

Major Components:
- CCB (Claude Code Bridge) system for multi-provider coordination
- Gateway API (http://localhost:8765) for unified AI access
- Agent Teams system for multi-agent collaboration
- Support for 9 AI providers: Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, iFlow, Kimi, Qwen, DeepSeek, Droid
- WebUI with authentication and real-time updates
- Skills system for extending agent capabilities
- NotebookLM and Obsidian integrations

Recent Work (Session 1 - 2026-02-15):
✅ Completed full rebrand from AionUI to Hivemind
✅ Updated all 603 files with new branding
✅ Pushed 12 commits to GitHub in organized batches
✅ Added Nexus integration components
✅ Established harness system for long-running iteration

=== CURRENT STATUS ===
Active Feature: None (harness initialization)
Next Priority: F001 - Enhanced Gateway API with Circuit Breaker

Environment Status:
- Working Directory: /Users/leo/.local/share/codex-dual/AionUi
- Git Status: Clean, up-to-date with origin/main
- Gateway API: Not verified this session
- Development Server: Not started this session

=== SESSION NOTES ===

Session 1 (2026-02-15):
- Initialized harness system based on Anthropic's long-running agent patterns
- Created features.json with 6 prioritized features
- Created this progress tracking file
- Created init.sh for environment setup
- Established baseline commit 1fc570a

Next Session TODO:
1. Run init.sh to verify environment
2. Start development server and test basic functionality
3. Begin work on F001 (Gateway Circuit Breaker)
4. Ensure clean git state before session end

=== ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS ===

1. Harness System:
   - Using Anthropic's two-agent pattern (Initializer + Coding Agent)
   - Features tracked in JSON with explicit passes status
   - Progress file maintains institutional memory
   - Each session focuses on ONE feature maximum
   - Clean git commits required before session end

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Will add Playwright for E2E testing (F006)
   - Browser automation for user flow verification
   - Mock providers for isolated testing

3. Multi-Agent Coordination:
   - Gateway API as central router
   - Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
   - Smart routing based on task classification

=== KNOWN ISSUES ===
None currently tracked.

=== DEPENDENCIES ===
- Node.js and npm (installed)
- Python 3 (for Gateway API)
- Git (installed)
- 9 AI provider CLIs (installed)

=== CONTEXT FOR NEXT AGENT ===
This is a fresh harness initialization. The project is stable at commit 1fc570a.
Priority work is on Gateway resilience (circuit breaker) and smart routing.
All features are defined in .harness/features.json.
Follow the standard session pattern: pwd → progress review → git status → feature work → test → commit.
